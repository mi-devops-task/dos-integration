## Overview

A few sentences what business problem this project solves...

## Quick Start

### Development Requirements

- macOS operating system provisioned with the `curl -L bit.ly/make-devops-macos-setup | bash` command
- `iTerm2` command-line terminal and `Visual Studio Code` source code editor, which will be installed automatically for you in the next steps

### Local Environment Configuration

Clone the repository

    git clone [project-url]
    cd ./[project-dir]

The following is equivalent to the `curl -L bit.ly/make-devops-macos-setup | bash` command. If that step has already been done it can be omitted at this point

    make macos-setup

There are essential configuration options that **must** be set before proceeding any further. As a minimum the following command will ensure that tooling like `docker` and `git` are going to operate as expected, including local secret scanning and code formatting are enabled. Make sure you have `tx-mfa` into non-prod first before running `make setup`

    make setup

Please, ask one of your colleagues for the AWS account numbers used by the project. The next command will prompt you to provide them. This information can be sourced from a properly set up project by running `make show-configuration | grep ^AWS_ACCOUNT_ID_`

    make devops-setup-aws-accounts

Generate and trust a self-signed certificate that will be used locally to enable encryption in transit

    make trust-certificate

### Local Project Setup

    # Terminal 1
    make build
    make start log

## Contributing

Here is the list of the development practices that have to be followed by the team and the individual members:

- Only use single canonical branch **master**. Any intermediate branch significantly increases the maintenance overhead of the repository.
- Apply the git rebase workflow and never merge from master to a task branch. Follow the **squash-rebase-merge** pattern to keep the history linear and clean.
- Cryptographically sign your commits using **gpg** to ensure its content have not been tampered with.
- Format the summary message of your pull request (merge request) using the following pattern **"JIRA-XXX Summary of the change being made"** for complies and clarity as well as to enable tooling to produce release notes automatically.
- Announce your PR/MR on the development Slack channel to allow any team member to review it and to share the knowledge. A change can be merged only if all comments have been addressed and it has been **approved by at least one peer**. Make good use of paring/mobbing/swarming practices for collaborative coding.

Before starting any work, please read [CONTRIBUTING.md](documentation/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more detailed instructions.

## Development

- Describe how to
  - Connect to a local database
  - Interact with mock components
  - Switch each individual component to the dev mode
  - Reference the [TODO.md](documentation/TODO.md) file
  - Provide guidance on how to use feature toggles and branching by abstraction

### Database Connection

To connect to the local postgres database use these connection

    Host = localhost
    Port = 5432
    Database = postgres
    Username = postgres
    Password = postgres
    Schema = postgres

### Code Formatting

  To format the code run:
    make python-code-format FILES=./application
    make python-code-format FILES=./test

### Code Quality

  To check the code quality run:
    make python-code-check FILES=./application
    make python-code-check FILES=./test


## Testing

List all the type of test suites included and provide instructions how to execute them

- Unit
- Component
- Integration
- Contract
- End-to-end
- Performance
- Security
- Smoke

How to run test suite in the pipeline

### Unit Testing

Unit testing is to test the functions within each lambda. This testing is done on the local system to where the commands are run e.g CLI, CI/CD Pipelines

This includes:This testing includes:

- Function calls
- Correct data types and data returned from function
- All paths tested of the application

This testing is generally done by a developer

To run unit tests run the following commands

    make python-requirements
    make unit-test

For coverage run

    make coverage-report

### Component Testing

Component Testing is to test the functional capabilities of the individual component(lambda). This testing is done on the local system to where the commands are run e.g CLI, CI/CD Pipelines

This testing includes:

- Logging
- Input & Output of component
- Calls to Mocks (DB/DoS API Gateway)
- Erroneous data passed into component
- Meets business needs of the ticket

This testing is generally done by a developer

To run components tests run the following commands

    make python-requirements
    make start component-test

### Integration Testing

Integration Testing is to test the functional capabilities of the individual component work together with mocks and partner services. Asserting that individual components can work in harmony together achieving the overall business goals.  This testing is done on AWS to test the connection between components.

This testing includes:

- Limited use of Mocks
- Check data when passed between components
- Meets business needs of the application

This testing is generally done by a tester

### Test data and mock services

- How the test data set is produced
- Are there any mock services in place

### Manual check

Here are the steps to perform meaningful local system check:

- Log in to the system using a well known username role

## Deployment

### APIKey

API Key must be generated prior to external API-Gateways being set up. It is automatically created when deploying with `make deploy PROFILE=task`. However the dev, demo and live profiles' key must be manually generated prior to deployment.

### Artefact Versioning

E.g. semantic versioning vs. timestamp-based

### CI/CD Pipelines

List all the pipelines and their purpose

- Development
- Test
- Cleanup
- Production (deployment)

Reference the [jenkins/README.md](build/automation/lib/jenkins/README.md) file

<img src="./documentation/diagrams/DevOps-Pipelines.png" width="1024" /><br /><br />

### Deployment From the Command-line

    make docker-build NAME=serverless # (TMP) Build Serverless docker image
    make serverless-requirements # Install serverless plugins
    make build-and-deploy PROFILE=task # Builds docker images, pushes them and deploys to lambda

#### Quick Deployment

To quick update the lambdas run the following command. Note this only updates the lambdas and api-gateway

    make sls-only-deploy PROFILE=task VERSION=latest

### Remove Deployment From the Command-line

    make undeploy PROFILE=task # Builds docker images, pushes them and deploys to lambda

### Secrets

Where are the secrets located, i.e. AWS Secrets Manager, under the `$(PROJECT_ID)-$(PROFILE)/deployment` secret name and variable `$(DEPLOYMENT_SECRETS)` should be set accordingly.

### AWS Access

To be able to interact with a remote environment, please make sure you have set up your AWS CLI credentials and
MFA to the right AWS account using the following command

    tx-mfa

- Be based on the open standards, frameworks and libraries
- API-first design
- Test-first approach
- Apply the automate everything pattern
- AWS-based cloud solution deployable to the NHSD CPaaS Texas platform
- Use of the Make DevOps automation scripts (macOS and Linux)
